We find that the scores on certain IQ metrics are highly correlated with the scores on others: for example, students who scored highly on the algebra test also tended to score highly on the arithmetic test. In trying to understand these relationships, we assume that the correlation between two IQ metrics reflects the fact that both are testing the same  _latent factors_ of intelligence, but perhaps in different proportions, and with different degrees of accuracy.\n",

    "We summarize this assumption below. In the graphical model, each node represents a random variable: the $z_i$'s denote the (unobserved) latent factors of intelligence, and the $x_i$'s represent the (observed) IQ test scores. The connections between nodes indicates a dependence relation. \n",

    "The most important conceptual difference between PCA and FA is that PCA is a _descriptive technique_, while FA is a _structural model_. This means that PCA does not assume any specific relationship between the principal components it identifies from the observed data, while FA makes a strong assumption about the causal relationship that exists between factors and the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, the two approaches differ in the kind of explanation they provide. In particular, principal components are the optimal entities for explaining the _variance_ of each dimension in the data, while factors are the optimal entities for explaining the _covariance_ between pairs of dimensions.\n",

    "In FA, we model the observed variables as linear functions of the latent factors. In PCA, however, we create _new_ variables that are linear combinations of the observed variables. \n",
