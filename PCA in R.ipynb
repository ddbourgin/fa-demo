    ">Principal Components Analysis (more commonly known as PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that's great and all, but as with most wikipedia definitions of statistical procedures, I don't really understand what this concise definition is telling me until I understand what the statistical procedure in question does from a more intuitive perspective.\n",

    "\n",
    "Genmoics research deales with huge datasets, ~3 billion DNA base pairs in the human genome (although subsets are usually analyzed), where each base pair can be considered a dimension across humans. In order to make their analyses manegable, many geneticits employ PCA to reduce the dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about dimensionality reduction is that it compresses a data set, by finding a smaller number of dimensions that do a \"good-enough\" job of representing the original data. This type of compression is called lossy because some information is lost. A classic example of applied compression is .mp3 music files. The original music files are very large, and so to make downloading them manegeable (at least back in the dark ages of the early 2000s), the music was compressed into mp3 files. While mp3 files don't use PCA to do compression, the concept is the same.  "

PCA and OLS are somewhat similar techniques, although they differ in important ways. \n",
